			<h2 class="content-subhead"> Greetings!</h2>
			<p>
				Salutations, internet adventurer! My name is Dacoda Nelson. I write things, and I also help businesses utilize their technology effectively. Sometimes I code, as well. This is a website I'm building in my somewhat tenuous free-time. It's not representative of my abilities at the moment, but it will be eventually.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead">Please Pardon The Mess.</h2>
			<p>
				This page is under heavy construction right now. Truth be told, it shouldn't even be accessible, but being able to test its reachability was important at this stage. Feel free to follow <a href="https://arxiv.org">this link</a> to a better website.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead">You've arrived!</h2>
			<p>
				This is the main homepage. It's not particularly useful because this website is intended to serve two functions. The first is as a portfolio/professional page for my writing. If that's what you're looking for, please click <a href="#Writing">this link</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second reason for this really ugly website to exist is as a place for information regarding Special Circumstances, the intellectual consultancy. If you're looking to inquire about or retain my services as an intellectual consultant, or if you're curious about what an intellectual consultant actually <i>does</i> then please <a href="#ICS">click here</a>.
			</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>I have a brain and, for as long as I can remember, people have been trying to convince me that it's actually a pretty good one. I am skeptical, as I am wont to do, but since so many people think it's a good brain, I have been loaning it out lately. I call this "Intellectual Consulting" and it's actually a pretty sweet gig. The easiest way to put it is thusly: if you need someone to think about something and then tell you what they thought, I can do that. I'm absurdly good at it, and I can think about all sorts of things; sometimes I can think about two or three things at once!</p>
				<p>I'll have more detailed information about the types of things I can think about for you here at a later date. I'll also include what sort of things I can produce for you as a result of that brainpower. It's stuff like proposals, reports, and advice; but it's also stuff like an infrastructure upgrade project, a custom-built piece of code to do that one thing that you desperately need done but can't find a retail product to do for you, or a fully-customized home or business automation system that doesn't rely on third-party servers to keep all your stuff doing what you want it to do.</p>
				<p>Given that this information is missing at present, if you have any questions about what I can and cannot do for you, or you're just a curious-minded person, then you can reach me via electronic mail at dacodanelson, and the part after the at symbol is the Google email service which you hopefully know the name of. I'd just put the whole thing here but then I'd be getting emails from bots all day and nobody wants that.</p>
